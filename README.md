# Radar plot for mcmc output
This [page](https://robertahrens.github.io/radar_plot_mcmc/assets/quarto-doc.html) explains the  multi_radar_plot function which creates radar (spider) charts for visualizing multiple datasets simultaneously. The function is particularly useful for displaying MCMC simulation results across different scenarios and metrics.

The code folder contains the [file](code/radar_plot_mcmc.R) **radar_plot_mcmc.R** which has the _multi_radar_plot_ function as well as code to generate synthetic data and produce the image above.
