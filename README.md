This [page](https://robertahrens.github.io/radar_plot_mcmc/assets/quarto-doc.html) explains the  multi_radar_plot function, which creates radar (spider) charts for visualizing multiple datasets simultaneously. The function is particularly useful for displaying MCMC simulation results across different scenarios and metrics.
