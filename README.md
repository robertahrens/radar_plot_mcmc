# Radar plot for mcmc output
This [page](https://github.com/robertahrens/radar_plot_mcmc/wiki) explains the usage of the multi_radar_plot function, which creates radar (spider) charts for visualizing multiple datasets simultaneously. The function is particularly useful for displaying MCMC simulation results across different scenarios and metrics.
